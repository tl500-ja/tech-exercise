# Load Testing

> Load testing helps us to understand how our application behaves in production. Even the application passes all functional tests, if it doesn't perform well, the end users become unhappy. For that reason, we should understand how our users interact with our applications and set realistic benchmarks for performance.

#### In your groups pick the tool you'd like to integrate the pipeline with:

| 🐈‍⬛ **Jenkins Group** 🐈‍⬛  |  🐅 **Tekton Group** 🐅 |
