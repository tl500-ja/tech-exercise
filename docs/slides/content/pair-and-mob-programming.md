### Mob Programming in Action

### Pair Programming
![Pair Programming](images/pair-and-mob-programming/coaching-coders-coding.jpg) <!-- {.element: class="inline-image"} -->
</br>
</br>
**Pair programming** is a practice used in e**X**treme **P**rogramming in which
two programmers work together at one computer.



### Mob Programming
![Mob Programming](images/pair-and-mob-programming/chairs-developer-development.jpg) <!-- {.element: class="inline-image"} -->
</br>
**Mob programming** is a software development approach where the whole team
works on the same thing concurrently, and at the same computer.



##### Why do it?
#### Pair Programming
* Enables knowledge sharing between team members
* Increases the quality of work because it is reviewed and improved simultaneously
* Builds trust between team members
</br>
</br>

#### Mob Programming
* Ensures that the whole team understands how a specific feature is implemented or a problem is solved
* Provides a quick way to onboard new team members



##### How do we do it?
#### Pair Programming
* The team member behind the keyboard and mouse is the driver. The driver focuses on performing the actual work.
* The other team member is the navigator or observer. The navigator focuses on the strategic outcome of the work the driver is performing.
* The navigator reviews the driver's work while it is done.
* While reviewing, the navigator focuses on the end goal and ensures the current task is working towards it.
* Switch the roles often, for example, every 15 minutes, so that the team members experience the different aspects of the work.



##### How do we do it?
#### Mob Programming
* Mob programming involves the whole team working on a single piece of functionality simultaneously. The easiest way to mob program is to have one team member driving a laptop that is connected to a large screen or projector.
* The person behind the keyboard and mouse is the driver and the other team members are the navigators. 
* Rotate the roles frequently while working on implementations. If you use this practice for knowledge sharing, then rotation is not necessary.
* Finally, the whole team implements the feature together by talking through the development.




### Class Exercise
‚è∞üé®üë®‚Äçüé®üñº



#### Individual Drawing

1. Everyone grab a small sticky note.
2. Each person grab a different color pen.
3. Draw Steven Tyler on your own sticky note.



#### Pair Drawing

1. Assemble in pairs (or trios if there is an odd number).
2. Each pair grab a medium sticky note.
3. Take turns drawing an element of Steven Tyler.



#### Mob Drawing

1. Assemble in table groups.
2. Each table grab an easel pad.
3. Take turns drawing an element of Steven Tyler.

##### Key Takeaways
- **Mentoring of team members:** Sharing tips and tricks or shortcuts can widen both pairs' skill depth. This sharing can also bring junior associates up to speed very rapidly.
- **Half the code:** Two minds working on the same problem makes for more efficiently written code, so less spaghetti.
- **No pull requests:** Code is reviewed as it's written, avoiding superficial reviews. The temptation to cut corners is reduced when pairing because someone is watching.
- **Team bonding:** Pair and mob programming facilitates interactions. Instead of sitting in a room with headphones on, ignoring the world around, developers in pairs or mobs look engaged and happier. Happy coders lead to better code.



##### Key Takeaways
- **The knowledge stays in the team:**  When holidays or flu season take over, the team can still continue to work at pace knowing the Unicorn is not leaving with key information.
