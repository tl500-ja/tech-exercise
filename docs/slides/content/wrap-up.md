# Let's Recap



### What did we do?
* Team Forming
* Discovery, Delivery, and Foundational practices
* Hands-on technical exercises
* Built two visualizations useful for any project
  * Practice Corner
  * The Big Picture




### Delivery Showcase & Demo Day



### The Showcase
#### _What is it?_
* An event where stakeholders and interested parties are given a demonstration of
recent work performed by a team
* The latest increment of the product is showcased with new features built by the team
* Provides an opportunity to review culture and practices used by the team
* It is often performed at the end of an iteration, but can be performed at key
milestones in the life of the product



### The Showcase
#### _Why use it?_
The showcase provides a critical feedback loop for products being incrementally
and iteratively built. Stakeholders can give feedback on the features as they
are developed, suggest improvements, give ideas for new features, and catch
problems early. <!--{.element: style="font-size: smaller; font-weight: 400;"} -->

#### _Other benefits_
* Provides an open forum for channeling feedback from stakeholders to product
leadership so that priorities and future work can be adapted accordingly
* Enables collaboration across all interested parties on a regular basis



### Demo Day
#### _What is Demo Day about?_
* Demo Day is the culmination of a trip around the Practice Loop.
* There will be several showcases or product increments that feed into the demo day.
* The team can showcase their work from a particular time period.
* Key stakeholders get to see the results.
* Provides an opportunity to discuss "what's next" and how do to adapt the team culture for the next round.
* A celebration !



### Demo Day
#### _Tips_
* "Show" NOT "Tell"
* Take this opportunity to drive excitement around the product **and** culture.
* The demo should include not only the product of a sprint or release, but also the **culture** and **philosophy** used to produce it.




### Choose your own adventure - Exercise A or B



### Exercise A: The Successful Demo Day 
#### In teams, take some time to brainstorm
* What have you taken away from this week's set of sessions and activities?
  * People, processes, **and** technology
* What did you learn about your team, class, or instructors?
* What did you enjoy?



### Exercise B: The Success Factors and the Anti-Patterns
#### In teams, take some time to brainstorm
* Demo Day - What are the things you would bring and show during a Demo Day?
* Success Factors - What are things or people who could help drive this new way of working and help with adoption?
* Anti-Patterns - What are the things that would hinder you or prevent you from succeeding? 



### Closing
* Closing comments round
* High Five
* CSAT
* SWAG
* Sharing social contacts



### Call to Action
* Use what you have learned.
* Reach out to your classmates and instructors.
* Use the resources shared during the class.
