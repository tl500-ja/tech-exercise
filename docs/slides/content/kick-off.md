![faces](images/kick-off/faces.png)



## Exercise
#### Gather your apparatus üî¨üßë‚Äçüî¨
1. Take a large Post-it note and a Sharpie marker.
2. Write your name on the top or bottom of the note (in portrait orientation).




## Exercise
#### Choose someone you've never met before
- Swap Post-it notes with your chosen partner <!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="1"} -->
- Set a 30 seconds timer<!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="2"} -->
- Draw a part of owner's face on the Post-it note <!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="3"} -->
  * Eyes <!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="3"} -->
- Swap back, admire the work, and then choose a new partner. <!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="4"} -->
- Repeat the process for more facial features <!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="5"} -->
  * Nose <!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="5"} -->
  * Mouth <!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="6"} -->
  * Hair <!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="7"} -->

#### Why Use Ice Breakers?
- Provides an effective way to start a team-building event
- Helps people get to know each other

#### When to Use Ice Breakers 
- Participants come from different backgrounds
- People need to bond quickly so they can work towards a common goal
- The team is newly-formed

All of these things are Information Radiators - they display information in real time and publicly.

<!-- .slide: id="information-radiators"-->
### Information Radiators
#### _An Information Radiator..._
- Visually represents and radiates all aspects of work.
- Typically, information useful to team members, stakeholders, and users is physically presented on walls, windows, doors, and other flat surfaces. Position the information in the line of sight of those people who get value from consuming it.
- Enables someone interested in the work to "Walk the Walls," meaning they can walk around the physical space where associated teams are working and get all the information they need by inspecting artifacts on the walls and from the resulting conversations.



### Information Radiators
#### _Why visualize work?_
- Facilitates a transparent and open way of working.
- Avoids hiding information about status, progress, direction, challenges, and opportunities related to a project.
- When important information is constantly accessible and visible to team members, both the speed and accuracy of their work can improve. Waste is reduced because the team spends less time searching for information.
- It is more likely that the information is accurate because people are continuously reminded of it.



## Exercise - Animals
![Draw an animal](images/kick-off/animals.png)<!-- {.element: class="inline-image"} -->
</br></br>
Draw a simple representation of an animal that you feel represents your current mood.



## Back to the Animals!
Introduce yourself to the group and share your animal.   
- What is your name?
- Where are you from?
- What is your current role within your organization?
- Show and Tell: Share your animal drawing



<!-- .slide: id="target-outcomes"-->
### Target Outcomes



#### What are your expectations for the week?

* Everyone grab a pen and a few sticky notes.
* Individually write your expectations (one per sticky note).
* Add them to a class board named "Expectations."
* Group the sticky notes by affinity.
* Discuss expectations by comparing them to the course's Target Outcomes.



#### _What are Target Outcomes?_
- A tool to capture and articulate the goals and outcomes that a team is striving to deliver
- Can include customer (end user) based outcomes as well as business and capability based outcomes
- Harnesses and summarizes the findings and learnings from other Discovery practices into a finite set of statements that can be publicly displayed for team and stakeholders to regularly reference



<!-- .slide: data-background-size="contain" data-background-image="images/kick-off/Output-vs-Outcome-vs-Impact.png" -->



### Learning Target Outcomes
#### _What are **our** Target Outcomes?_
- Generate enthusiasm for DevOps culture and practices.
- Explore all of the principle practices used in everyday discovery and delivery.
- Have fun!



#### Target Outcomes - World Health Organization <!-- .element: class="title-bottom-left" -->

### Exercise - Team Formation
* Form a straight line across the room in order of relative technical experience in development engineering practices.
* Assign each person a number, 1,2,3, or 4, to divide the group into balanced teams.
* Each member assigned the same number is on the same team
