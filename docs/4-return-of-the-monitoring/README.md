# Exercise 4 - Return of the Monitoring

> A metrics-driven transformation focuses on using value-based business metrics to understand how technology-related investments impact organizational performance and provide specific tools and guidance to help improve those metrics.

With software, there are often two competing forces at work. Innovation, which inherently is accompanied by system change, and running software, which is serving end customers and implies that the system is stable. We can identify two important areas to focus on here:

- To help measure the effectiveness of a team's development and delivery
practices
- To start measuring and monitoring activities that allow the rapid diagnosis
of issues

## üë®‚Äçüç≥ Exercise Intro

In this exercise, we will use OpenShift out-of-the-box monitoring and logging stack. We will collect PetBattle metrics with `Prometheus` and set alerts with some sensible tresholds. Also visualize PetBattle metrics with `Grafana` to have a better understanding of PetBattle's status. Moreover, we will gather logs of the apps to store in `ElasticSearch` and visualize them with the help of `Kibana`.
