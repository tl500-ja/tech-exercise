#### _What is it?_

* A mechanism for sizing different work items *relative* to each other
* A tool to facilitate conversations, especially where there are different views on relative sizes
* Other names you may have heard for this exercise: relative estimation, planning poker, counting the number of work items



#### _Why use it?_

* Facilitates conversation
* Helps align groups to reach consensus on their understanding regarding the size of, complexity, and/or value of an item
* Avoids the emotion, buffering, and other negative side effects of absolute estimation



#### _How do we do it?_
_Things to consider before starting_ <!--{.element: style="font-size: smaller; font-weight: 100;"} -->
* First, the product backlog refinement and the sprint planning must be done.
* Then, you pick up the user stories for the next sprint and put them into the Relative Estimation board.



#### _How do we do it?_
1. Draw a ladder and agree on the points to use. A common practice is to use the Fibonacci series or T-Shirt sizes.

![fibonacci-series](images/estimation/fibonacci-series.png)<!-- {.element: class="" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; max-width:40%;" } -->

2. Then, begin sizing for the stories. The first step is to identify the 1-pointer and the 13-pointer.
3. Next, compare the other user stories to the previous items:
    - Perhaps the second user story is a bit harder, so let's call that a 2-pointer
    - Consider the story that follows. We must ask ourselves how much harder or easier it is compared to the others.



#### _How do we do it?_
_An example_ <!--{.element: style="font-size: smaller; font-weight: 100;"} -->
* 'Is Story A bigger than the 3 points we have here?'
* Assuming yes, ask "Is it bigger than the 8 pointer? Or is it roughly the same size?"
* Assuming no, "Okay, then let's say it is a 5 pointer."



### Exercise - Fruit Salad ü•ó
#### _Relative Estimation_
In 60 seconds ‚è±...

* Individually, write down as many fruits as you can think of, the wilder and weirder the better.



### Exercise - Fruit Salad ü•ó
#### _Relative Estimation_
* As a Team
  * Combine the fruits into a single list and remove duplicates.
  * Create rows on a board and label them 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 13.
  * Perform a Relative Estimate of your fruits based on how hard is to peel and cut each fruit.

#### Key Takeaways
</br>
As we go through these estimations, conversations occur within the team and you'll discover more as understandings beginning to align.

In this exercise these new discoveries might include things such as:
  - Someone has a tool that makes opening coconuts easier, so perhaps it doesn't require as much effort as you first thought.
  - The orange has pips in it and it's also more difficult to peel than the banana.

#### Facilitation Tips
A helpful tool for big planning
* The relative estimation line is a technique that helps planning by allowing for quick and easy estimation based on past experience.
* It is important to avoid stories that are too big and are carried over multiple sprints. Because the story is never "done", the points cannot be cashed in.
