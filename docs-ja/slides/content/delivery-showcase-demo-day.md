## Delivery Showcase & Demo Day



### The Showcase
#### _What is It?_
* An event where stakeholders and interested parties are given a demonstration of
recent work performed by a team
* The latest increment of the product with new features built by the team is
showcased
* Provides an opportunity to review culture and practices used by the team
* It is often performed at the end of an iteration but can be performed at key
milestones in the life of the product



### The Showcase
#### _Why Use It?_
The showcase provides a critical feedback loop for products being incrementally
and iteratively built. Stakeholders can give feedback on the features as they
are being built, suggest improvements, give ideas for new features, and catch
problems early.

**Other benefits**
* Provides an open forum for channeling feedback from stakeholders to product
leadership so that prioritization and future work can be adapted accordingly
* Enables collaboration across all interested parties on a regular basis



### Demo Day
#### _What is Demo Day about?_
* Demo Day is the culmination of a trip around the Practice Loop
* It is an opportunity for the team to showcase their work from a particular
time period
* An opportunity for key stakeholders to see the results
* May have had many showcases or product increments completed feeding this
* An opportunity to talk about "what's next" and how do to adapt the culture for
the next round
* An opportunity to celebrate!



### Demo Day
#### _Tips_
* "Show" NOT "tell"
* Take the opportunity to drive excitement around the product **and** culture
* The demo should include not just the product of a sprint or release but of
the **culture** and **philosophy** used to produce it



### Choose your own adventure - Exercise A or B



### Exercise A: The Successful Demo Day 
In teams, take some time to brainstorm:
* What have you taken away from this week's set of sessions and activities:
  * People, processes **and** technology
* What did you learn about your team, class, or instructors?
* What did you enjoy?



### Exercise B: The Success Factors and the Anti Patterns
In teams, take some time to brainstorm:
* Demo Day - What are the things you would bring and show during a Demo Day?
* Success Factors - What are things or people who could help drive this new way of working and help with adoption
* Anti Patterns - What are the things that would hinder us or prevent us from succeeding?
