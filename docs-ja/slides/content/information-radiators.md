### Information Radiators
#### _What is an Information Radiator?_



### Information Radiators
#### _An Information Radiator..._
- Involves radiating and visually representing all aspects of work.
- Typically means information that is useful to team members, stakeholders and users is physically presented on walls, windows, doors and other flat surfaces and positioned in the line of sight of those people who will get value from consuming the information.
- Enables the ability to "Walk the Walls", where someone interested in the work can walk around the physical space the associated team(s) are working from and get all the information they need from inspecting artefacts on the wall and from the resulting conversations.



### Information Radiators
#### _Why visualize work?_
- Facilitates a transparent and open way of working.
- Avoids hiding information about status, progress, direction, challenges and opportunities related to a project.
- Where important information is constantly accessible and visible to people, both speed and accuracy of their work can improve with reduced wastage from having to search for information.
- It is more likely that the information is accurate because people are continuously being reminded of it.
